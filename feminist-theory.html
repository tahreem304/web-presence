     <h1>FEMINIST THEORY</h1>
     <p>Dr. Bonnie Zare received her doctoral degree in English at Tufts University, her masters degree at the University of Wisconsin, and her bachelor’s degree at Stanford University, all in English. She has written numerous articles, journals, and even books on women’s studies in India, Indian culture, and incarceration.</p>
<br>
<p>Her hobbies include parenting, singing (she is a Soprano), and used to be an amateur actress in community theaters.</p>
<br>
<p>Feminist Theory is one of the gateway classes to women’s and gender studies, and it sure is demanding. It makes sense though, because it’s probably hard to jam in every feminist theorist since the 1700s in four months. We have five critical reading assignments due throughout the semester, and these force us to really extract the strengths, weaknesses, and main arguments in the weekly readings assigned to us. At the end of the year, we write a critical comparative theory essay where we put two or more theorists in conversation with one another and argue for what we believe is the best theory for understanding and supporting our topic. We supplement this essay with a presentation introducing our topic to the class. Don’t be fooled by the fact that this a 2000 level class, because it sure grinds its students hard. </p>

<p>Expected grade: A
