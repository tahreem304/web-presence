     <h1>RESEARCH AND WRITING IN INTERNATIONAL STUDIES</h1>
     <br>
     <p>Madison Tepper is a graduate teaching assistant at Virginia Tech and has been working on her PhD in Alliance for Social, Political, Ethical, and Cultural Thought (ASPECT) for a little over two years. Her research focuses on neo-nationalist movements and the broader global nationalist movement trend. She looks at these through marxist-feminist and post-colonial perspectives.
Tepper received her bachelor’s degree in international relations, political science, and French from Salisbury University. She received her master’s degree in political science from Virginia Tech. Now, she is teaching Research and Writing in International Studies along with doing her doctoral research.</p>
<br>
  <p>Tepper enjoys cooking and reading during any rare spare time.</p>

  <p>Class: Usually every morning, the class discusses any domestic and global current events, so that we can stay relevant in our discussions. We are required to read from two different textbooks (names) to learn about research topics and to know how to structure our papers. Since this class is about learning how to write good research papers, all of the assignments lead up to one research paper that is due on our final exam day. Some of the work we do include research-paper elements like annotated bibliographies, literature reviews, and groupwork on how to write good research questions and how to conduct proper research.</p>

  <p>Expected grade: A
